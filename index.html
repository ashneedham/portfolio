            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a father, husband and web developer based in Derbyshire, UK and have been working in the software industry for over 13 years, but tinkering on the web for much longer. Starting out in the early days when dial-up was a luxury, until your mum needed the phone to make a call. </p>
            <p>Initially working with Frontpage I got to grips with the basics of web technology and built on my knowledge from there. From creating my first guestbook on Bravenet to starting my first social media profile on MySpace, I have seen the web change along my skills. </p>
            <p>I have many hobbies to fill my spare time, including: touring the UK with my family in our mini home on wheels, disconnecting from all things digital by escaping to the country on my self powered mountain bike and kicking back with some music (preferably on physical media) after a long day in the office.</p>
            <p>The world wide web has always fascinated me with it's seemingly endless possibilities and that's what drives me with all the work I do.</p>

                <h3>Bespoke web software development</h3>
                <p>Spending many years dealing with multiple industries has given me the necessary experience to plan, develop and deploy bespoke web software / applications. </p>
                <p>Software development is more than just writing code. At it's heart it is problem solving. Defining the situation and then deciding the best approach to satisfy it. </p>
                <p>With several years of experience as a senior developer, I have tackled many challenges and helped many companies realise their potential. A key to this is in the understanding of the internet, the world wide web and the core principles that define it.</p>
                <p>I primarily work with a PHP, MySQL, Linux stack. This allows for a very flexible development model that can be deployed in pretty much any hosted environment. But I also have experience with other languages and database systems, some not so common.</p>

                <h3>Web API development</h3>
                <p>Automated communication between external (or even internal) systems can be vital for efficient data transfer. I have experience working with many third party APIs and developing API interfaces for small and large companies (including market leaders in the financial industry).</p>
                <p>The key to a good API is keeping the facility simple. It needs to be simple to work with for other developers who need to integrate with it, and it needs to be simple to maintain for the team who work on it. Good design is vital to achieving this which is dependant on experience.</p>

                <h3>Frontend interface development</h3>
                <p>Frontend development (done properly) requires many roles. It's not just about writing HTML and CSS with a little bit of Javascript, it's about planning the whole journey through the website / application. </p>
                <p>Wearing the hat of a UX designer (User Experience designer), the flow of the website is determined. Deciding what calls to action to implement and the most suitable location to drive the most interaction from them is important.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of frontend development is taking the design and crafting it into code, whilst making it flexible and responsive to work for all devices. Keeping true to the design is a skill obtained over many years of website development, and achieved with knowledge of how the world wide web has changed over time.</p>
